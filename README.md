- Project During the Internship at **GMO Niko Inc**(Japan). The company creates user interface for advertisement price and sale management.

- Developed a system to identify images of advertisements displayed on the GMOs website, which hosts over 5,000 internet advertisements. The objective was to transfer the information to a new system platform efficiently.

- During the development of the detection platform, SQL was employed for data gathering and management, with Python serving as the primary programming language responsible for constructing the system dedicated to image detection within the dataset. This approach significantly expedited transferring information for over 10,000 advertisements in 1 day.
